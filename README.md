# ABSA
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using BERT &amp; LDA Algorithms

1. Dataset: TripAdvisor with hotel reviews.
2. Data cleaning: Cleaning from URLs, emojis and emoticons, unicode
normalization, correction of spelling errors
3. Data preprocessing: Data preprocessing includes tokenization, abstraction
stop word, stemming and/or lemmatisation.
4. Sentiment tags: Taged data to match the
scores 1-2 as negative, 3 as neutral and 4-5 as positive.
5. Extract Facets: Use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to extract
the views for each review.
6. Sentiment Classification: Explore/development of at least 2 analysis models (LDA & BERT)
of sentiment predicting sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for each facet that
is determined, using machine learning and deep learning techniques
7. System evaluation: Evaluation metrics (e.g. F1-score, accuracy, precision,
recall) to evaluate the performance of each model on feature extraction and classification tasks
emotion. Use of cross-validation and other related techniques for assurance
reliable and impartial assessment. Added techniques for handling unbalanced
datasets and achieving high model performance. Rate and compare
different sentiment classification techniques.
8. Benchmarking: Comparison of performance of different ABSA models
9. Research study: Scientific article
